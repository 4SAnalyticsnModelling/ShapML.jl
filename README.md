# shapML
An `R`, `Python`, and `Julia` library for interpretable machine learning with stochastic causal Shapley values

* This will be the new home for the causal Shapley values computed in my experimental `R` package shapFlex.

* Roadmap
    + Build a `Julia` version of the symmetric Shapley value calculation from `shapFlex`.
    + Build a `Python` version of the symmetric Shapley value calculation from `shapFlex`.
    + Write unit tests and simulations for the causal Shapley values in `R` in `shapFlex`.
    + Implement the causal Shapley value in `Julia` and `Python`.
    + Realease `shapML` on CRAN for `R`.
    + Realease `shapML` on pkg.julialang.org for `Julia`.
    + Realease `shapML` on on PyPi for `Python`.
    + Write an article for the `R` journal.
